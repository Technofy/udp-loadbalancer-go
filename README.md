# UDP IPSec Load balancer in go

Simple UDP Load-Balancer which also supports IPSec.

The load balancing is done using IP Source hash.

## Features
 - UDP load balacing with or without IPSEC
 - Loadbalacing to static IPs or AWS Autoscaling Group
 - Software health metric on AWS CloudWatch
 
 
## Configuration

The file `config.yaml` contains your application configuration. The one present by default contains some example to get you started.

- Upstream

> This section contains all the target groups. They can be either IP addresses, or AWS Auto-scaling Group.

- Servers

> This section contains how is the traffic load balanced.

* Pacemaker

> This object tell the Load Balancer where to update it's health status. This is allowing us to monitor it trough CloudWatch.

Here's a example config:

```python
###################
# Configure here
###################
## List of servers to load balance to
# Load Balancing to AWS autoscaling group
 - name: vpn_servers
   type: aws_autoscaling_group
   hash: remote_ip
   targets:
    - myAutoScalingGroup

# Load Balancing to static servers
 - name: static_servers
   hash: remote_ip
   targets:
    - 10.0.0.2
    - 10.0.0.3
    - 10.0.0.4

## Load balancer Listeners and redirect
servers:
  - bind: 0.0.0.0
    port: 500
    proto: udp
    pass: static_servers:500

  - bind: 0.0.0.0
    port: 4500
    proto: udp
    pass: static_servers:4500


## Cloudwatch metric to monitor the health of the load balancer
pacemaker:
  region: eu-west-1
  interval: 10
  namespace: IPSecLB
  metric: Healthy
```

### IAM Actions required:

* cloudwatch:putMetricData
* ec2:DescribeInstances
* autoscaling:DescribeAutoScalingGroups

Example role with access on all ressources:

```
